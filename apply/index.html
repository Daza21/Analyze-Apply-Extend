    <p>I am using Atom as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p>Before you begin coding a website, you must first create a
      wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan for accessibility.</p>

<p>After reading Chapter 1, I now understand how to download and use a text editor to create an HTML page. I know which HTML elements are required to create a basic HTML webpage.</p>
